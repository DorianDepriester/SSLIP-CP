# SSLIP-CP
Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity (SSLIP), with Crystal Plasticity considerations.

## Purpose of this repository
This version of [SSLIP](https://github.com/Tijmenvermeij/SSLIP) [1], (originally developped by [T. Vermeij](https://github.com/Tijmenvermeij)) has been updated to account for Crystal Plasticity constitutive laws [2], namely:
- incremental straining,
- strain hardening,
- crystallographic reorientations,
- slip anisotropies.
