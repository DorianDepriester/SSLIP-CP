# SSLIP-CP
Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity (SSLIP), with Crystal Plasticity considerations.

## Purpose of this repository
This version of [SSLIP](https://github.com/Tijmenvermeij/SSLIP), (originally developped by [T. Vermeij](https://github.com/Tijmenvermeij)) has been updated to account for Crystal Plasticity constitutive laws, namely:
- incremental straining
- strain hardening
- crystallographic reorientations
- slip anisotropies
